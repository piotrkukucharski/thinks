# Think

Think is a note-taking application that focuses on a tag-based approach to organizing and retrieving notes. Unlike other
note-taking applications that either operate within a file system or emphasize relationships between notes, Think offers
a unique approach that revolves around tags. Each note must be assigned one or more tags, which can then be used to
search and retrieve previously created notes. Additionally, Think allows for creating connections between notes, further
enhancing the organization and structure of your notes.

## Features

- Tag-based note organization: Assign tags to each note for easy categorization and retrieval.
- Connections between notes: Create links and connections between related notes.

## Installation

Please note that Think is currently in the development stage and not yet available for installation. However, we are
actively working on its development and will provide updates on its progress.

## Future Plans

At present, Think does not have a specific license. As the development progresses, we will carefully consider licensing
options and choose the one that aligns best with the goals and values of the project.
